# Voronoi_Map_Searching_Visualization
An in-terminal visualization of breadth-first and depth-first searches performed on a map procedurally generated using Voronoi Diagram principles.
This program is written in C++ and utilizes the ncurses library for employing basic visual effects in terminals.
You will either need to have the ncurses library downloaded in order to compile this program, or you can simply download and run the already-compile executables.
